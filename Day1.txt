What is Ansible?
----------------------
	configuration mangmt tool

	Tool
	--save cost
              for what? managing a server(s)
	--save time
	      for what? Deploying a App(s) on server(s)
	-- improve quality and efficiency
              consitent change done all server(s)

	--- management
	
	---configuration
	--configuration of server(s)

   what is there in each server?
		so we manage their config?
        Resources
---------------------------
	-packages
        -files
	-directories
	-services
	-users
	-group
	-policy

Finally 
we are managing the above in multiple servers using ansible

Ansible is written in python
from redhat
Ansible release
	-Ansible 	-CMD - FREE -Open Source

=======================================================================================

Ansible can manage
	Hardware
		Hypervisor manages hardware
			Ansible manage hypervisor software by that it manages hardware

	software
		-files,directory,packages,services
	people
		-users,groups
	process
		-policy

WHY Ansible?
-------------
    Ansible is easy to 
	Learn - Test -Debug - share - Extend


easy to learn comparing 
	PERL
	PYTHON
	BASH
	PS
	JAVA and any other..

	Ansible is platform independent

               works on all platform

        Ansible is ideompotent
	
	what is ideompotent?
	------------------------
	1 Run- 10 steps all the 10 steps os run in servers              =10 mins
	2 Run - 10 steps -0 changes then nothing runs in servers	= 0 mins
	3 Run - 10 steps - 2 change - only that 2 steps will run in servers = 2 mins
	it saves time so it is ideompotent


        Ansible is consitent server change mangement

	save time because it has parallel deployment

	all the deployments in all the servers occurs parallely

        and saves cost

How Ansible works? Ansible Architecture?

Human -> Ansible control server(ACS) - Ansible Remote server(s)(ARS)

        --> Ansible + 10+tools
	--> Ansible configuration file
	--> Ansible playbook(Role) - YAML file -Deployment Script
	--> Ansible Inventory - DNS/IP address of ARS

Human say hey ansible read the configuration file if their is any change follow the playbook
it will have all the logic steps and run it on Ansible inventory


	ACS               ARS
